# # **Python Practice Problems (No Code Included)

# **Directions:** Solve each problem by writing your own Python code. Show outputs where required.


# ### **Problem 1: Print Numbers 1 to 10
list=(range(1,11))
print(list)
# Write a program that prints the numbers from **1 to 10**, each on a new line.
for i in list:
    print(i)
# ### **Problem 2: Sum of Numbers

# Ask the user for a number **n**, then calculate and display the **sum of all numbers from 1 to n**.
n= int(input("Enter a number:"))
total=0
for i in range (1, n+1):
    total+= i
print("The sum of numbers 1 to", n , "is:", total)

# ### **Problem 3: Factorial Calculator

# Ask the user for a number **n**, then calculate the **factorial** of that number.
n1= int(input("Enter a number:"))
# *(Example: factorial of 5 is 120)
#5! multiplies all the numbes from 1-5
def factorial(n1):
    factorial=1
    
    for i in range (n1):
        factorial*=i+1
    return factorial
print (factorial(n1))
# ### **Problem 4: Count Vowels**

# Ask the user for a string. Count and print how many **vowels (a, e, i, o, u)** are in the string.


# ### **Problem 5: Print Even Numbers**

# Ask the user for a number **n**, then print all **even numbers** from 2 up to n.
n = int(input("Enter a number: "))
list2 = list(range(2,n))
for i in list2:
    if i % 2 == 0:
        print("even",i)
    else:
        print("odd",i)


# ### **Problem 6: Reverse a String**

# Ask the user for a string, then print the string **backwards**.



# ### **Problem 7: Multiplication Table**

# Ask the user for a number **n**, then print the **multiplication table** for n from
# n × 1 up to n × 10.



# ### **Problem 8: Count Occurrences**

# Ask the user for **two strings**, a and b.
# Determine how many times **string b appears inside string a**.



# ### **Problem 9: Fibonacci Sequence**

# Ask the user for a number **n**, then print the first **n numbers** of the Fibonacci sequence.



# ### **Problem 10: Pattern Printing**

# Ask the user for a number **n**, then print a pattern of stars where the first row has 1 star, the second has 2, and so on until row n.

# *(Example for n = 4)*
# *
# **
# ***
# ****



# If you want, I can also turn this into a **Google Doc**, **worksheet**, **PDF**, or **Canvas/Schoology assignment format**.
