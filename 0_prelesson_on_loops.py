While loops  
#for loops=execute code over a fixed range of time, you can iterate (go through) over a range, shirt, sequence, etc.

# credit_card= "1234-5678=9012-3456"

# for x in range(1, 11, 3):
#     print(x)

for x in range(1,21):
    if x == 13:
        break   #break will cut the program at that section while continue will just skip that value 
    else:
        print(x)
